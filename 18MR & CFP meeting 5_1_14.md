18MR & CFP meeting 5_1_14
Present: Stephen & Cayden

1) For their membership, they are looking for a way to capture granular information for ethnicities, language, and also accommodating alternate gender identities.

2) They currently use Action Kit

3) They are very interested in expanding the social media integration. Functions such as tracking the means on how members find them, but also how their dedicated networks interact with each other - such as if person X, sent a facebook invite to person Y and then person Y joined. The CRM should track that person Y was invited by person X via facebook

4) Furthermore, some deeper networking data points Cayden might like to see on members is other means they might be related. My assumptions are things like family membership, maybe if they went to the same school or schools, and also perhaps what campaigns they've work on together.

5) One complaint Cayden had was the Action Kit has a lot of functionality, but it is too cumbersome and they never use a lot of the features and functions.

6) They use Action Kit to generate lists for mailings

7) Cayden also mentioned they are looking at ways to do fee for service integration and also semi-integration into campaigns and they would want to have a way to easily partition their membership by which campaign the member has been assigned to. We discussed having an end-user created means to set up how many and which campaigns their members would be involved in, and then having the ability to assign their members which user-created campaign they are associated with.
