This document is key research in understanding the work of The New Organizing Institute, 18 Million Rising and United We Dream.  

Background:

New Organizing Institute:
For Organizers, By Organizers
Theory of change: if people have the skills to engage others, the tools to build power campaigns, and a community of practice to help them learn and grow, they can win real change, make measurable improvements in people’s lives, and restore faith in our government and our democracy.

They provide tools, trainings, and resources to organizers to increase their personal and professional power. 

Engagement Organizers start with time-tested grassroots organizing strategies, grounded in the behavioral sciences and hardened in the field. We combine these strategies with emerging online tools and technology.

Four main principles for Engagement Organizers:
Fight. Stand up and take responsibility, not just to criticize the world, but to forge a path forward.
Engage. Invite others to join the fight, not just as bodies or wallets, but as whole people, with brains, skills, networks, and so much more.
Learn. Rigorously analyze what's working and what's not, and empower everyone on the campaign with that data.
Win. Settle for nothing less than real, concrete change that measurably improves our lives.
	
18 Million Rising (18MR): 
The Asian and Pacific Islander (AAPI) population is rising faster than any other minority group, yet, they are the most politically under–organized, under–engaged, and under-represented constituencies. 
18MR seeks to represent the 18 million Americans in the United States.
They create campaigns centered on creating awareness, activism, and presence through online tools and an online “call to action”.
The agency is composed of a “connected array of AAPI activists, artists, organizations, and digital media influencers.”
