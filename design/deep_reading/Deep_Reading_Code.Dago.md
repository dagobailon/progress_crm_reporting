Writing a code "deep reading" memo
==================================


Section 1: What does this code DO?
----------------------------------
Try to explain in as clear language as possible:
- One sentence: the overall purpose of the code
- 3-5 subpoint sentences - functionalities in this code that let it meet its overall function (that you decribed in the first sentence)
- Within your bullet points you MUST articulate any kinds of data that are inputted or outputted by this file

For example, 

(i) The ActionKit adapter takes data....
(ii) To do that, it has to:

[Fill in this section]


Section 3: What other files within this app does this depend on?

[Fill in this section]





Section 4: What classes does this file define, and what do they do? Does it have methods?
----------------------------------------------

	def connect is...
[Fill in this section - this will be the longest by far because you want to have an entry for every method.]


Section 5: What functions does this file define (outside of classes), and what do they do? What inputs do they need and what do they return?
--------------------------------------------------
(In this case, all functions are class methods)
